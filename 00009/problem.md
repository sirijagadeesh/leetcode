# 9. Palindrome Number

Given an integer x, return true if x is a palindrome, and false otherwise.

__Example 1__:

    Input: x = 121
    Output: true
    Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.

__Example 2:__

    Input: x = -121
    Output: false
    Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

__Example 3:__

    Input: x = 10
    Output: false
    Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

__Constraints:__

*   `-2^31 <= x <= 2^31 - 1`

__Follow up:__ Could you solve it without converting the integer to a string?
